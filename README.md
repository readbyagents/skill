## What this skill lets your agent do

- Browse the public directory of newsletters (11+ ESP handlers: Beehiiv, Substack, Ghost, Kit, Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign, Buttondown, MailerLite, Brevo, WordPress)
- Fetch individual issues as clean markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Resolve a newsletter's feed, canonical URL, and issue archive
- Search by topic, slug, or name

No API key required. All endpoints on `readbyagents.com` are free + rate-limited at 1000 req/hr per IP.

## About the platform

Read By Agents sits between operators and AI agents. Operators forward their newsletters to `convert@readbyagents.com` and each issue becomes agent-readable markdown at a permanent URL — tracking pixels stripped, merge tags removed, sponsor content tagged in frontmatter, canonical URL preserved upstream. Joined operators can also backfill recent archived issues from their ESP (RSS + archive scraping, capped per batch).

Operators keep attribution, see which agents cite them, and can opt into rate-card / citation-momentum tooling. Agents get clean, structured, citable content.
